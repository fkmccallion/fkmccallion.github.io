"I enjoy building things.  Web development allows me to build things with virtually no overhead.  I only need a computer and some inspiration.  The web is ubiquitous; it touches every aspect of our lives.  Every industry it touches it shifts its paradigm.  Whether it is music, finance, marketing or even a social network it's impact cannot be understated.  It's a relatively new technology on par to the first Industrial Revolution.  It's powerful and exciting and that is why I decided to learn web development."
