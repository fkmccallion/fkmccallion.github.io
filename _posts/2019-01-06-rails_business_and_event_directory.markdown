The concept behind this app is for users to create accounts, register thier organizations and to add events for each of thier organizations.  Additionally, they can apply categories and tags to thier organizations and events to improve visibility on the home page view.  As each organization, event, category and tag is selected its ranking is increased and is displayed more prominently on the home page.

This is strickly a backend rails app with no bells or whistles; that portion will come in later.

This project was very educational in that it allowed me to go back through the earlier lessons and reapply the subject matter to my independent app.  Building out the basic framework of the app spotlighted how important it is to thoroughly think out what the app is to do prior to starting which helps with applying separation of concerns and DRY concepts to minimize the workload of refactoring.
