"A few years ago I had developed a website using the following: ASP.NET Framework, C#, HTML5, JQuery and SQL Server.   The site had been developed for being read on a desktop, typically by clients at work, and had a static design."  

"Soon afterward, SEO became a priority and the first order of business was to make the site mobile friendly.  Media queries and other CSS tricks proved to be very time consuming and the art of refactoring a static website to a responsive design turned out to be a very cumbersome task; so much so that the expedient solution was to develop a parallel site for mobile devices.  Although this was a good solution for the time it became very apparent that updating and expanding two parallel sites at the same time was just as cumbersome."

"Responsive design was the ultimate answer.  The bootstrap framework contains all the tools necessary to create a responsive design using a mobile first approach.  Ultimately, this framework cuts development time and produces a fluid and dynamic interface for both desktop and mobile devices."
